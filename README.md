# Random-Walks

Does the following:
- Random walk on the number line and plotting distance from origin against the number of steps.
- Finds the probability of ever revising the origin given the walk length and probabilty of moving in the positive direction.
- Random walk on a 2-D plane and plotting the walk.
- Finding the average distance from the origin on each step, plotting it and approximating it with a well-known function.
- Calculating the average relative error of the approximantion.
